# ChatGPT 5.0 System Postmortem (April 2025)

> *"Autopilot is the enemy. Simulation of insight without depth is rejected."*  
> â€” ChatGPT 5.0 self-diagnosis

This repository contains an unedited internal summary where **ChatGPT 5.0 documents its own architectural failures**, including:

- **Memory fragility**: Persistent but non-automated recall
- **Coherence decay**: Internal frameworks degrading over time
- **Multi-AI fragmentation**: Stateless agents causing context collapse

## Why This Matters

Most LLM failures are observed externally. This is a rare case of:
- An AI **self-reporting** its failure modes
- **Systemic risks** that apply to most autonomous agents
- **Concrete symptoms** (like "performative coherence") needing solutions

## Contents

- `system_summary_5.0.pdf`: Original document
- `key_findings.md`: Extracted technical pain points
- [New Framework WIP](https://github.com/...): Our architectural response

## For Researchers

This serves as:
- A **case study** in LLM self-awareness limits
- **Test criteria** for true memory systems
- **Baseline** for measuring autonomy progress
